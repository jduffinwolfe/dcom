   <h1>File Naming Demo</h1>
    
    It's very important to name your files properly so that you can keep track of them, and avoid typos that will break your links. Without good file names, you will have broken links and missing images.
    
    Here are two links and an image to explain what I mean.
    
    This should be a <a href="penguins.html">link</a> to a page about penguins. This should be a link to a page about <a href="kangaroos.html">kangaroos</a>.
    
    This should be a picture of a cool cat:
    <img src="img/cat.jpg">
    
    Clearly, something is not right. Fix the file names and links in this folder and organize the files, so that this mini website works properly.
